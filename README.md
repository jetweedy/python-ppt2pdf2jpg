## Overview

These files are used to convert ppt(x) files to pdfs, and then to convert the first pages of those pdfs to jpgs. It was primarily used to post presentations with thumbnails on the Carolina Health Informatics Program website. Every semester I was being given a number of powerpoint presentations to post, and it was becoming pretty tedious to convert them to PDFs (the format that the director preferred to post them in) and then make an image out of the first page... so I decided to learn a little more about Python and whip up a script to do it for me.

## Couple of technical notes:

Each of the two conversion files may require some customization to look in the correct paths.

You'll also need to create 'pdf', 'jpg' and 'ppt' folders in the same directory if they aren't already there.
