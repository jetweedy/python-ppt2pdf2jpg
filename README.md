## Overview

These files are used to convert ppt(x) files to pdfs, and then to convert the first pages of those pdfs to jpgs. 
It is primarily used to post presentations with thumbnails on the Carolina Health Informatics Program website.
Each of the two conversion files may require some customization to look in the correct paths.
You'll also need to create 'pdf', 'jpg' and 'ppt' folders in the same directory if they aren't already there.
